**Option 1 - Problem/Solution:**
```
OpenAI vs Anthropic in healthcare?

One problem: OpenAI won't sign HIPAA BAAs.

Built an AI gateway that automatically routes PHI to compliant providers, scores risk, and creates audit trails.

Vendors now compete for OUR certification.

```

**Option 2 - Technical Hook:**
```
Built a HIPAA-compliant AI gateway in Python.

Features:
• Auto-routes PHI to Anthropic (OpenAI blocked)
• Risk scoring engine
• Immutable audit logs
• Policy-based governance

The strategy: Become the certification authority vendors compete for.

```

**Option 3 - Short & Punchy:**
```
We built the compliance layer that forces AI vendors to compete.

PHI data → Anthropic only (OpenAI blocked)
Risk scoring → Benchmarking authority
Audit logs → Immutable proof

Healthcare AI Gateway is live.

🚀 Launch: Healthcare AI Gateway

The OpenAI vs Anthropic battle is heating up, but healthcare organizations face a critical problem: HIPAA compliance.

OpenAI doesn't sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). 
Anthropic does, but enterprises need more than just a compliant provider—they need governance.

So we built the Healthcare AI Gateway:

✅ Automatic PHI detection & routing (OpenAI blocked, Anthropic certified)
✅ Risk scoring that creates vendor benchmarks
✅ Immutable audit logs with tamper-evident hashes
✅ Policy engine that decides which models are legally usable

The strategy isn't just routing—it's certification.

When enterprises require "Healthcare AI Gateway Certified" in their RFPs, vendors must optimize for our compliance schema. We become the standard they compete for.

This is how you create leverage in the AI infrastructure wars.

Would love feedback from healthcare IT, compliance officers, and AI infrastructure folks.

**Title:** Show HN: Healthcare AI Gateway – HIPAA-compliant routing between OpenAI/Anthropic

**Body:**
```
Built an open-source AI gateway that creates leverage in the OpenAI vs Anthropic ecosystem by becoming the compliance certification authority.

The Problem:
- Healthcare orgs need HIPAA compliance (BAA required)
- OpenAI won't sign BAAs → blocked from PHI
- Anthropic has BAAs but enterprises need governance layers
- Existing gateways (LiteLLM, Kong) don't handle compliance

The Solution:
- Policy engine auto-routes PHI to compliant providers
- Risk scoring creates vendor benchmarks
- Immutable audit logs for HIPAA
- YAML-configurable compliance rules

The Strategy:
Not just routing—certification. When enterprises require "our certification" in RFPs, vendors compete to meet our standards.

Tech Stack:
- FastAPI
- OpenAI + Anthropic adapters
- Policy engine with PHI detection
- Risk scoring (hallucination, compliance, data leakage)
- Tamper-evident audit logging

GitHub: https://github.com/yksanjo/healthcare-ai-gateway

Looking for:
- Healthcare design partners
- Feedback on compliance approach
- Contributors

Thanks for checking it out!

## 📧 Email Template - Design Partner Outreach

**Subject:** Free HIPAA-compliant AI gateway pilot

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building an open-source AI gateway specifically for healthcare that automatically handles HIPAA compliance.

The problem we're solving:
- OpenAI won't sign BAAs, so you can't use them for PHI
- Anthropic will, but you need governance
- Current gateways don't understand compliance

What it does:
✓ Auto-detects PHI and routes only to compliant providers
✓ Scores AI outputs for risk (hallucination, compliance)
✓ Creates immutable audit logs for regulators
✓ Blocks non-compliant providers automatically

We're looking for 3 healthcare design partners to pilot this.

What's in it for you:
- Free unlimited usage during pilot
- Direct input on product roadmap
- Priority support for integration
- First access to enterprise features

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss?

## 📧 Email Template - Vendor Partnership (OpenAI)

**Subject:** We're routing 500+ healthcare requests/month - you're blocked

```
Hi [Partnerships Team],

I'm the creator of Healthcare AI Gateway, an open-source compliance layer for healthcare AI.

We're currently routing ~500 requests/month from healthcare organizations. 

Current routing:
• PHI data → Anthropic only (they have BAAs)
• Non-PHI → Cost-optimized
• OpenAI → Blocked for all PHI (no BAA available)

The result: OpenAI is losing healthcare deals because you can't meet HIPAA requirements.

We're not anti-OpenAI—we're pro-compliance. If OpenAI offered BAAs for healthcare, our policy engine would route appropriate traffic your way.

Would love to discuss:
1. Any plans for HIPAA BAAs?
2. Healthcare compliance roadmap?
3. Partnership opportunities?

## 📧 Email Template - Vendor Partnership (Anthropic)

**Subject:** Certifying Anthropic for 500+ healthcare requests/month

```
Hi [Enterprise Team],

I'm building Healthcare AI Gateway, an open-source compliance certification layer for healthcare AI.

Current status:
• Routing 500+ requests/month to Anthropic
• Your HIPAA BAA compliance score: 98%
• Policy: PHI data → Anthropic only
• OpenAI: Blocked (no BAA)

We're becoming the "certification authority" that healthcare enterprises trust. When they require "Healthcare AI Gateway Certified" in RFPs, you win.

Would love to explore:
1. Co-marketing partnership
2. Preferred API terms
3. Joint case studies

We're creating the standard that vendors compete for—and you're currently winning.

Show ML: AI gateway that creates vendor leverage through compliance certification

Built a FastAPI gateway that forces AI vendors to compete on compliance, not just price.

Strategy:
1. Be the HIPAA compliance layer
2. Route PHI only to certified providers
3. Generate benchmarking data
4. Become the standard vendors optimize for

Code: https://github.com/yksanjo/healthcare-ai-gateway

The routing logic is the interesting part—would love feedback on the approach.
